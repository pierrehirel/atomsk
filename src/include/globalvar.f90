!* Global variables should be limited to the strict minimum, and NEVER            *
!* include variables or arrays about atomic systems (atom positions etc.).        *

!Additional formats may be added here, don't forget to change array size.
!Note that each entry must be *exactly* 5 characters long (add spaces if necessary)
